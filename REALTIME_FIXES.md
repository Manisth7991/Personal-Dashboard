# Real-Time Updates Fixes Applied ✅

## Issues Identified and Resolved:

### 1. **Duplicate Real-Time Updates**
- **Problem**: Same "LIVE: Real-time Update" content was being added repeatedly every 30 seconds
- **Solution**: 
  - Added variety to real-time updates with multiple title and description options
  - Implemented proper cleanup to keep only the most recent real-time update
  - Added unique IDs with timestamp and random string to prevent duplicates

### 2. **Conflicting Real-Time Hooks**
- **Problem**: Two different real-time hook files (`useRealTime.ts` and `useRealTimeUpdates.ts`) causing confusion
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed duplicate `useRealTimeUpdates.ts` file
  - Consolidated functionality in `useRealTime.ts`
  - Fixed import references in StatusIndicator component

### 3. **TypeScript Type Errors**
- **Problem**: Real-time content items had incompatible metadata types causing build failures
- **Solution**: 
  - Created type-safe real-time items that match existing content structure
  - Properly handle movie vs news metadata differences (rating vs author fields)
  - Used type assertions and any types where necessary for `isRealTime` flag

### 4. **Content Management Issues**
- **Problem**: Real-time updates were accumulating without proper cleanup
- **Solution**: 
  - Filter and manage real-time vs regular content separately
  - Keep only 1 recent real-time update at a time
  - Maintain original content order while adding new real-time items at the top

## Changes Made:

### **File: `src/app/page.tsx`**
- Enhanced real-time update logic with variety:
  - 5 different news update types
  - 5 different movie update types
  - Random selection from categories
- Improved content management:
  - Proper filtering of real-time vs regular content
  - Cleanup of old real-time updates
  - Type-safe item creation

### **File: `src/components/ui/StatusIndicator.tsx`**
- Fixed import reference for useRealTimeUpdates
- Removed API invalidation that was causing issues
- Simplified update callback

### **File: `src/hooks/` (Cleanup)**
- Removed duplicate `useRealTimeUpdates.ts`
- Consolidated all real-time functionality in `useRealTime.ts`
